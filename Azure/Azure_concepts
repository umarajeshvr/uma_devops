🌩️ Azure Offerings Overview

Azure (Microsoft’s cloud platform) provides three main service models:

IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

PaaS – Platform as a Service

SaaS – Software as a Service

We'll focus on the first two since you asked about IaaS and PaaS.

🧱 1️⃣ Azure IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
🔹 Definition

IaaS gives you the basic building blocks of cloud IT — virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking.
You manage everything from the operating system upward, Azure manages the hardware.

⚙️ You manage

Operating System (Windows/Linux)

Applications

Middleware (e.g., IIS, Apache)

Runtime

Security patches, configurations

☁️ Azure manages

Physical servers

Data center infrastructure

Azure Virtual Network (VNet)	Build your private network inside Azure
Azure Load Balancer	Distribute traffic among multiple VMs
Azure Storage	Store files, disks, and backups
Azure Backup / Site Recovery	Disaster recovery & data protection
Azure VPN Gateway	Connect on-prem network to Azure securely
Example Use Case

You want to migrate your on-premise servers to Azure as-is.
You create VMs, install your OS, database, and applications manually.
You control everything — just like a data center, but in the cloud.

⚙️ 2️⃣ Azure PaaS (Platform as a Service)
🔹 Definition

PaaS gives you a ready-made platform for building, running, and deploying apps without worrying about servers or OS.
Azure manages almost everything — you just focus on your application code.

⚙️ You manage

Application code

Data (optional)

☁️ Azure manages

OS, runtime, middleware

Infrastructure

Scaling, availability, patching, security

🧩 Common Azure PaaS Services
Service	Description
Azure App Service	Host web apps, REST APIs, mobile backends — auto scaling built-in
Azure SQL Database	Managed SQL Server – no need to manage DB engine or OS
Azure Functions	Serverless compute — run code without managing servers
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)	Managed Kubernetes (somewhere between PaaS & IaaS)
Azure Logic Apps	Automate workflows and integrations
Azure Service Bus	Messaging between applications
Azure API Management	Secure and publish APIs easily
=====================================================
1️⃣ Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
🔹 Definition

An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a logically isolated network in Azure that allows your resources (VMs, app services, databases, etc.) to communicate securely with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

It’s like your own private data center network inside Azure.

🔹 Key Features
Feature	Description
Isolation	Each VNet is isolated from other VNets (unless you connect them).
Subnets	Divide your VNet into smaller sections (e.g., web, app, DB tiers).
Private IPs	Azure assigns private IPs to resources inside the VNet.
Network Security Groups (NSGs)	Control inbound/outbound traffic.
Peering	Connect two VNets seamlessly without a VPN.
Integration	VNets connect to Azure services like App Service Environment, AKS, etc.

2️⃣ Azure VPN (Virtual Private Network)
🔹 Definition

An Azure VPN (via Azure VPN Gateway) is a secure, encrypted tunnel that connects:

Your on-premises network to Azure VNet, or

Two VNets in different regions.

It uses IPsec/IKE protocols over the internet to ensure privacy and security.
============================================
1️⃣ Azure Monitor
🔹 Definition

Azure Monitor is the centralized monitoring service in Azure.
It collects, analyzes, and acts on telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces) from:

It helps you understand:
How your applications are performing
Whether your infrastructure is healthy
When anomalies occur
What it does

Collects data (metrics, logs, events)
Analyzes data (queries, visualizations)
Alerts when something goes wrong
Integrates with dashboards and automation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2️⃣ Log Analytics
🔹 Definition (where all monitoring data is stored, queried, and analyzed.”)

Log Analytics is a feature inside Azure Monitor.
It’s a workspace where all logs (activity logs, metrics, diagnostics, etc.) are collected and stored for querying and analysis using Kusto Query Language (KQL).

🔹 Purpose
It helps you query logs, detect issues, and analyze root causes.

🔹 Example👇
Azure Monitor detects high CPU on your VM.
You open Log Analytics Workspace and run a KQL query:
Perf
| where ObjectName == "Processor"
| summarize AvgCPU = avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
This shows CPU usage every 5 mins.
You find that a specific process (w3wp.exe) spikes CPU — you’ve found the root cause.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Azure Security Center (Now called Microsoft Defender for Cloud)
🔹 Definition

Azure Security Center (now part of Microsoft Defender for Cloud) is a unified security management system that provides:
Threat protection
Security posture management
Compliance monitoring
for your Azure, on-premises, and hybrid environments.
Example

In your company:

You deploy 10 Azure VMs and a SQL database.

Defender for Cloud scans them and finds:

3 VMs missing endpoint protection

SQL DB not encrypted at rest

It shows these under “Security Recommendations”, assigns a Secure Score = 65%,
and tells you how to fix issues (e.g., “Enable Microsoft Defender for Servers”).
If a VM is attacked with brute-force SSH logins, Security Center will:
Detect the anomaly
Alert the admin
Suggest blocking that IP or enabling NSG rules
==========================================================================================
1️⃣ Azure Backup
🔹 Definition

Azure Backup is a cloud-based backup solution that automatically backs up your data — whether from Azure VMs, on-prem servers, databases, or files — to Azure Recovery Services Vault.

It provides long-term data retention, encryption, and restore options.

🔹 Key Features
Feature	Description
Automatic backups	Schedule daily/weekly backups for VMs, databases, files, etc.
Recovery Services Vault	Central place to store and manage all backups.
Encryption & Compression	Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
Retention policies	Keep backups for days, months, or years.
Restore flexibility	Restore a full VM or specific files from a backup.

2️⃣ Azure Site Recovery (ASR) — Disaster Recovery Solution
🔹 Definition

Azure Site Recovery (ASR) provides Disaster Recovery (DR) by replicating your workloads (VMs, apps, servers) from:

On-premises → Azure, or

Azure region → another Azure region.

If your primary site goes down (power outage, natural disaster, ransomware attack),
ASR allows you to failover to the secondary site with minimal downtime.

🔁 Azure Backup vs. Azure Site Recovery
Feature	Azure Backup	Azure Site Recovery (DR)
Purpose	Protects & restores data	Keeps workloads running during outages
Type	Backup solution	Business continuity solution
Data Scope	Files, folders, VMs, DBs	Entire VM, app, or site
Use Case	Accidental deletion, data corruption	Natural disaster, power failure, cyberattack
Downtime	Some downtime during restore	Minimal downtime (automatic failover)
Destination	Backup vault (same region)	Secondary Azure region or on-prem site
=======================================
azure serverless computing;

1. Azure Functions

Purpose: Run event-driven code (like AWS Lambda).

Use cases:

Process messages from Azure Queue Storage

Respond to HTTP requests or webhooks

Automate tasks (e.g., resize uploaded images in blob storage)

Example:

A Function triggers when a file is uploaded to Azure Blob → resizes and saves a thumbnail.

⚙️ 2. Azure Logic Apps

Purpose: Automate workflows with no code/low code visual designer.

Use cases:

Connect apps/services (e.g., Outlook, SharePoint, Salesforce)

Send alerts when a file is updated

Schedule data syncs between systems

Example:

When an email with an attachment arrives → upload file to OneDrive → notify in Teams.

🌐 3. Azure Event Grid

Purpose: Event routing service for building event-driven architectures.

Use cases:

Send events between services (Functions, Logic Apps, Blob Storage, etc.)

Central event hub for microservices communication

Example:

When a resource changes in Azure → trigger a Function or Logic App.

💬 4. Azure Event Hubs

Purpose: Ingest millions of real-time events per second for analytics or streaming.

Use cases:

IoT data streaming

Telemetry collection

Real-time dashboards

Example:

Stream device data to Event Hub → process with Azure Stream Analytics → push to Power BI.

🔄 5. Azure Service Bus

Purpose: Reliable message queue between services or applications.

Use cases:

Decouple apps using message queues or topics

Handle asynchronous workloads

Example:

An API sends messages to Service Bus → Azure Function processes them asynchronously.

📊 6. Azure Container Apps (Serverless Containers)

Purpose: Run containers without managing Kubernetes or servers.

Use cases:

Microservices

APIs

Background jobs

Example:

Deploy Docker containers that automatically scale to zero when idle.

💡 Summary Table
Service	Type	Description	Example Use Case
Azure Functions	Compute	Run small pieces of code on demand	Image processing, APIs
Logic Apps	Workflow Automation	Integrate services with visual workflows	Automate business workflows
Event Grid	Event Routing	Manage and route events between services	Trigger events on resource changes

============================================
🔹 Definition:
Redundancy in Azure refers to duplicating resources — such as servers, storage, networking, or data — across multiple locations or systems, so that if one fails, another automatically takes over.

🔹 Types of Redundancy in Azure
Type	Description	Use Case / Example
1. Local Redundancy (LRS)	Data is copied 3 times within a single data center in one region.	Protects against hardware failure within the same data center. (e.g., Azure Storage LRS)
2. Zone Redundancy (ZRS)	Data is replicated across 3 Availability Zones in the same region.	If one zone goes down, data is still accessible from others.
3. Geo-Redundancy (GRS)	Data is replicated to a secondary region hundreds of km away.	Disaster recovery protection (e.g., region-wide outage).
4. Read-Access Geo-Redundant (RA-GRS)	Like GRS, but allows read access to the secondary region.	Useful for reading data during regional failovers.
5. Application-Level Redundancy	Deploying apps in multiple regions or zones for high availability.	Use Traffic Manager or Front Door to route users.
6. VM Redundancy (Availability Sets / Zones)	Multiple VMs deployed in different fault/update domains or zones.	Protects against host server or zone failure.
