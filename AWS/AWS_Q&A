# 1. What is AWS?
Answer: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that provides a variety of services like computing power, storage options, networking, and databases on a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

# 2. What are the main benefits of AWS?
Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down.
Flexibility: Wide variety of services and tools.
Cost-effective: Pay-as-you-go model.
Reliability: High availability with multiple regions.
Security: Strong compliance and built-in security features.

# 3. What is the difference between EC2 and S3?
EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud is a service that provides resizable compute capacity for hosting applications.
S3: Simple Storage Service is used to store and retrieve data objects.

# 4. What is the use of an AMI in AWS?
Answer: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, including the operating system, application server, and application software.

# 5. What are Regions and Availability Zones in AWS?
Regions: Geographically isolated locations with multiple data centers.
Availability Zones (AZs): Data centers within a region that are isolated but interconnected for fault tolerance.

Intermediate Questions

# 6. What is the difference between Security Groups and Network ACLs?
Security Groups: Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances; operate at the instance level and are stateful.
Network ACLs: Act as a firewall for subnets; operate at the subnet level and are stateless.

# 7. Explain how auto-scaling works in AWS.
Answer: Auto-scaling ensures that your application scales up or down based on predefined conditions, such as CPU utilization or network traffic, using Launch Configurations or Auto Scaling Groups.

# 8. What are AWS Lambdaâ€™s use cases?
Event-driven applications (e.g., image processing, IoT).
Running serverless APIs.
Data transformations for analytics.
Scheduled tasks like cron jobs.

# 9. How does AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) work?
Answer: ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances or containers, in one or more Availability Zones.

# 10. What is Amazon RDS, and what are its advantages?
Answer: Amazon Relational Database Service is a managed database service. Advantages include automatic backups, scalability, high availability, and automated updates.

Advanced Questions
# 11. How do you secure data in AWS?
Use IAM policies for access control.
Encrypt data at rest with AWS KMS or SSE.
Encrypt data in transit with TLS/SSL.
Use VPCs and Security Groups.
Regularly audit with AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config.

# 12. What is the difference between instance store and EBS volumes?
Instance Store: Temporary storage tied to the lifecycle of an EC2 instance.
EBS (Elastic Block Store): Persistent storage that remains even after instance termination.

# 13. What is the purpose of Amazon CloudFront?
Answer: CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that securely delivers content (e.g., websites, videos) with low latency and high transfer speed.

# 14. What is AWS VPC, and how is it used?
Answer: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to define and launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network. It provides control over IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways.

# 15. How do you implement high availability in AWS?
Use multiple Availability Zones (multi-AZ).
Set up Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancers.
Use RDS Multi-AZ deployments.
Employ cross-region replication for disaster recovery.


Scenario-Based Questions
# 16. How would you migrate an on-premises application to AWS?
Analyze application requirements.
Select appropriate AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS).
Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for database migration.
Leverage AWS Snowball for large data transfers.
Test and validate the application post-migration.

# 17. How do you troubleshoot EC2 performance issues?
Check CPU/memory utilization using CloudWatch.
Examine disk I/O and network bandwidth.
Use VPC Flow Logs to analyze network traffic.
Verify instance type suitability.

# 18. What are the steps to set up an S3 bucket policy for public access?
Create an S3 bucket.
Configure bucket permissions using a JSON policy granting public read access.
Test access using a public URL.

# 19. How do you set up cross-region replication for an S3 bucket?
Enable versioning for both source and destination buckets.
Set up IAM permissions for replication.
Configure replication rules in the source bucket.

# 20. What are AWS CloudFormation stacks, and why are they useful?
Answer: CloudFormation stacks allow you to define and manage AWS infrastructure as code using templates. This enables consistent, repeatable, and automated deployments.
